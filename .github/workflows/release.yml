          > **Disclaimer**: This whole thing was vibecoded but it does seem to work
          
          ## Installation
          1. Download and mount the DMG
          2. Drag SpotifyOverlay.app to Applications  
          3. **If you get "damaged" warning**: Right-click the app → Open (instead of double-clicking)
          4. Launch it once (it will request accessibility permissions)
          5. Add to Login Items for auto-start
          
          ## Security Note
          This app is unsigned, so macOS will show a security warning. Use "Right-click → Open" to bypass this safely.
